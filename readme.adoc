== grunt-asciidoctor-assemble
This is a grunt script that uses AsciiDoc or Markdown files to produce a mini-website. This is a combination of grunt-asciidoctor and assemble. Thanks @anthonny_q for grunt-asciidoctor.

=== Getting Started

This script requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used http://gruntjs.com/[Grunt] before, be sure to check out the http://gruntjs.com/getting-started[Getting Started] guide.


=== Usage

* Put AsciiDoc or Markdown text files into /docs directory
** Code supports .adoc or .md files

At command prompt, cd to your project directory and run
 
 > grunt

Asciidoc files are converted into html and placed in /website directory

=== How it works

.clean
* grunt-contrib-clean is set to delete all files out of the /rendered directory each time
* it also cleans out the .html files from the /website directory
* This was you can add or delete content files in the /docs directory without worrying about removing dead files from your /website

.grunt-asciidoctor
* Takes .adoc and .md files in /docs directory
* Renders .html files into /rendered directory

NOTE: Asciidoctor is set to render the body only

.assemble
* Takes AsciiDoc rendered .html files in /rendered directory
* Assembles these by injecting each file into the template from /template directory
* saves as .html into /website

NOTE: NameOfFile.adoc converts to NameOfFile.html

=== Relies on Template and supporting CSS

.bootstrap-starter-template.hbs

* This is basic bootstrap page and it is a Handlebars template.
** each AsciiDoc rendered html file is injected into the Handlebars {{> body }} in the template.
* You can modify this template by changing the  links in the top and side navigation menus to fit your website.
* Substitute this template with your HTML page. Just place Handlebars {{> body }} in your template where you want the AsciiDoc content to go. Rename .html to .hbs to make it a Handlebars template.

TIP: Use summary.adoc file to build your navigation menu. Maintain your menu link changes in this file. Run grunt. This will produce a summary.html file. Copy HTML links out of this and paste into the template and save. Run grunt again. (...someday it would be nice to have this built into the template, but I don't know Handlebars yet.)

.website/content directory

* Requires one Asciidoctor CSS theme found in /website/content/AsciiDocThemes
** this must be linked in the template
* All other files are related to Bootstrap.
Can be safely replaced with your own code.


== Install
* Copy this entire project to your project directory.
* Replace text files in /docs with your own
** grunt script only supports .adoc or .md files
* at command prompt, cd to your project directory
* at command prompt, run "grunt" (requires grunt to work)
* click on /website/index.html to view in browser
* Next, go back and modify /template/bootstrap-starter-template.hbs to fix links to yours.
* run grunt again

=== How I set this up
You don't need to do this if you have just downloaded the project,
because all this code is already there. These are just notes on how I
did it from scratch.

* run "npm install" at command prompt

 > npm install

* this will read the package.json and download
** node_modules_
*** assemble
*** grunt
*** grunt-asciidoctor
*** grunt-contrib-clean

* I chose to use Bootstrap as my template. 
** downloaded Bootstrap (used 3.2.0)
** placed into \website\content\
